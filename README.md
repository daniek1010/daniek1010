# 💫 About Me:
I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through enterprise solutions and microeconomics, backed by my MSc in Mgmt of Textile Trade, and Retail. Currently, I’m sharpening my software engineering skills at 42 School, diving into the depths of backend development, cloud platforms, and everything in between.<br><br>Fun fact: transitioning from management to programming has taught me one thing—at least code does what I tell it to (most of the time). If only management worked the same way!
